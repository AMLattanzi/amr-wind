PRACTICAL ISSUES: 
* change variable names (e.g. we don't want u_g, just u)
* benchmarking (update README.md)
* test suite (update README.md)
* write users guide / documentation (update README.md)

CODE DEVELOPMENT: 
* get EB to work, test: flow past cylinder, then sphere
* AMR
* non-Newtonian fluids
